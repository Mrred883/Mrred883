## Hi👋, I'm Onyekachi Agudosi

I'm a DevSecOps and Security Automation Engineer who enjoys helping teams move fast without cutting corners on security.

I've worked in large cloud environments where reliability really matters, building automated infrastructure and delivery pipelines that make releases smoother and less risky.

I'm especially interested in practical security - things like Zero Trust, cloud security, and compliancedone in a way that supports developers instead of slowing them down.

Using tools like [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Python](https://github.com/features/actions), and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), I focus on creating systems that are secure, scalable, and easier for teams to work with every day.
